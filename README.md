# What I Learned

## ReactJS
- How to build a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- How to manage state and props effectively.
- How to integrate third-party libraries like Chart.js for data visualization.

## Python (Flask)
- How to create a RESTful API to serve data.
- How to connect to a SQL Server database.
- How to handle CRUD operations.

# Challenges Faced

## Backend-Frontend Integration
Initially, I faced issues connecting the React frontend to the Flask backend due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. I resolved this by enabling CORS in the Flask app.


## Database Setup
Setting up and connecting to SQL Server was tricky, especially handling data types and ensuring proper connection strings. I used pyodbc to manage the connection.
