Challenges Faced & Solutions

Backend-Frontend Integration

Issue: Initially, I faced issues connecting the React frontend to the Flask backend due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors.Solution: I resolved this by enabling CORS in the Flask app using the Flask-CORS library.

Dynamic Chart Updates

Issue: Updating the line chart dynamically based on the selected trade_code was challenging.Solution: I learned how to use React state and props effectively to update the chart dynamically whenever a new trade_code was selected.

Database Setup

Issue: Setting up and connecting to SQL Server was tricky, especially handling data types and ensuring proper connection strings.Solution: I used pyodbc to manage the connection and properly configured the connection string to ensure seamless data retrieval.
